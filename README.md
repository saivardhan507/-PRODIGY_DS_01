Greetings,

Enclosed is my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. Within this task, I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a World Population Dataset, with a specific emphasis on generating a visualization to depict the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.  

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/saivardhan507/-PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/71a6241dcefde04e4a662fdf77e9cd212eda3ac1/worldpopulationdata.csv">world_population_dataset</a>. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization



### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process encompassed the following key stages:

1. **Data Cleansing**: Thoroughly assessed the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and outliers, implementing appropriate remedial measures.

2. **Visualization**: Utilized bar charts and stacked charts to visually represent the distribution of both categorical and continuous variables within the dataset.

### Conclusion

In summary, the EDA undertaking has yielded invaluable insights into the distribution of the chosen variable within the dataset, thereby establishing a robust foundation for subsequent exploration and modeling endeavors in the data science workflow.

Your time and consideration in reviewing this submission are greatly appreciated.
